##PyHound - A Packet Sniffer in Python

_By:_
_Pratik Kshirsagar, Chinmay Terse_ _and_ _Rahul Agarwal_

## To Do

- Interpret HTTP data (tcp.dest_port will be 80)

###Packet Sniffer
Computer software that can __intercept and log traffic__ flowing through a network or part of a network is called 
Packet Sniffer.
<br />
It works by setting the __NIC (Network Interface Card) in Promiscuous Mode.__
Promiscuos Mode is that mode in which the controller sends all traffic that ir receives to the CPU, instead of only those packets it is intended to receive.
<br /><br />
_Other Modes: Monitor Mode_

###How Data Is Exchanged on the Internet

1.	An __HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) request__ is sent to the target server for the requested resource.
2.	This HTTP request is wrapped inside an __IP packet__ (Internetworking Protocol).
3.	All of this is packed in an __Ethernet frame.__

So, in the implementation of the packet sniffer, we first have to unpack the Ethernet frame.

__Protocol Numbers__<br/>
1 		&nbsp;&nbsp;ICMP (Internet Control Messaging Protocol)<br/>
4		&nbsp;&nbsp;IP-in-IP encapsulation (IP version 4)<br/>
41		&nbsp;&nbsp;IPv6 encapsulation (IP version 6)<br/>
6		&nbsp;&nbsp;TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)<br/>
17		&nbsp;&nbsp;UDP (User Datagram Protocol)<br/>
8 		&nbsp;&nbsp;EGP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_Gateway_Protocol">Exterior gateway Protocol</a>)<br/>
9		&nbsp;&nbsp;IGP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_gateway_protocol">Interior Gateway Protocol</a>)<br/>


###Sockets

A socket is one end-point of a two-way communication link between programs on the network. Sockets are bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application the data is destined to.

###Advantages and Limitations
_Advantages_

1.	Easy to understand.<br />
	The system is easily understandable because simple socket programming concepts have been used.

2.	No extensive requirements.<br />
	This system has no extensive requirements and can run on any unix/linux system which has a basic Python compiler and terminal.

_Limitations_

1.	Does not store the packet information and data.<br />
		The biggest problem with the developed system is that, the program doesnâ€™t store the data, it just displays it and once the terminal is closed the information is gone.

2.	Cannot run on windows.<br />
		Another drawback is that, this program uses a socket function which is not available in windows version of python, but exclusive to linux/unix systems.

3.	Only core functionality available.<br />
		Other supplementary and complimentary functionalities are missing.
